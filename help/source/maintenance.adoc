== Maintenance

*Introduction:*

These insights apply to both PKCMD (Windows) and PKCMD-LX (Linux).

*Solution Architecture:*

These components are key for a complete solution:
[start=1]
 . RAR (Windows) or .tar.gz (Linux) file

 . AppImage (Linux)

 . PKPlusDeviceFile.dat file

 . ini file (Windows)

_RAR/.tar.gz file_
PKCMD (Windows) comes as a RAR file containing an installer. To install, first extract the installer and then run it.

PKCMD-LX (Linux) comes as a .tar.gz file. To update PKCMD-LX:
1. Unpack the .tar.gz file. It contains two AppImages: one 32-bit, the other 64-bit.
2. Move the appropriate AppImage for your PC architecture, along with the provided DAT file, to replace your existing files. The DAT file must be located alongside the AppImage, in order for PKCMD-LX to find it.
3. You may then delete the .tar.gz file and any extraneous files you do not require.
4. Ensure that the AppImage has the executable permission (using `chmod +x /path/to/appimage`)

_PKPlusDeviceFile.dat file_

To update just the DAT file, simply replace your existing file with the new one.

The DAT file must be located alongside your PKCMD exe (Windows) or PKCMD-LX AppImage (Linux).

_ini Files_

PKCMD (Windows) has an `.ini` file, which you may modify if desired.

[TODO: specifics of ini file]

PKCMD-LX (Linux) does not currently use a configuration file of any sort.
